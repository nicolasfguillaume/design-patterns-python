# Decorator Coding Exercise

# You are given two types, Circle and Square, and a decorator called ColoredShape.

# The decorator adds the color to the string output for a given shape, just as we did in the lecture.

# There's a trick though: the decorator now has a resize() method that should resize the underlying shape. 
# However, only the Circle has a resize() method; the Square does not â€” do not add it!

# You are asked to complete the implementation of Circle, Square and ColoredShape.
